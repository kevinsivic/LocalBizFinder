Thanks for the clarification! I’ll compile a list of at least 50 and up to 500 independently owned businesses in Buffalo, surrounding areas, and Ellicottville, focusing mainly on retail and food services, while including a mix of other types as well. I'll organize the data into a structured CSV file with fields for Name, Website, Phone Number, Location, Business Type, and Description.

I'll get started and let you know once it's ready!
